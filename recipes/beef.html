            <li>1.5 tsp each salt and pepper</li>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves crushed</li>
            <li>1 large onion chopped</li>
            <li>2 celery ribs chopped</li>
            <li>2 carrots chopped</li>
            <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 cups (500ml) dry red wine</li>
            <li>2 cups (500ml) beef stock/broth, low sodium</li>
            <li>2 sprigs thyme</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 160°C/325°F.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle beef all over with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large ovenproof pot over high heat. Add half the ribs and brown aggressively all over (~5 - 7 min in total). Remove and repeat with remaining ribs, then remove.</li>
            <li>Turn heat down to medium. Add onion and garlic into the same pot and cook for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add carrot and celery, cook for 5 minutes until carrot is softened and sweet.</li>
            <li>Add tomato paste and cook for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add wine, broth, thyme and bay leaves. Stir until tomato paste is dissolved.</li>
            <li>Return beef into liquid, arranging them so they are submerged (Note 3).</li>
            <li>Cover with lid and transfer to oven for 3 hours, or until the meat can easily be pried apart with forks. (Note 4 Other cook methods)</li>
            <li>Remove beef carefully, keeping the meat on the bone. (Note 4) Cover to keep warm.</li>
            <li>Strain all liquid in the pot, pressing juices out of the onion, carrot etc. (Optional - can skip if you don't mind chunky sauce) Return sauce into pot, bring to simmer and stir. Adjust as necessary - simmer to reduce/thicken, add water to thin, season with salt and pepper if needed.</li>
            <li>Place beef on serving plate, spoon over sauce. Serve!</li>
        </ol>
