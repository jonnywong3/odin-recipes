        <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
        <p>This Chinese tomato egg stir-fry is something you’ll find on many Chinese home dinner tables. It’s fast, easy, cheap, and made with very simple, everyday ingredients.</p>
        <p>You’ll really be surprised at how tasty it is. The tangy tomatoes, mixed with rich scrambled eggs, a hint of sugar, and flavorful sesame oil and Shaoxing wine all come together to create a very satisfying (and vegetarian!) dish that tastes lovely on a bed of rice.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 small to medium tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 scallion</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp white pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 tsp shaoxing wine</li>
            <li>3 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 tsp sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 - 1/2 cup water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by cutting tomatoes into small wedges and finely chop the scallion.</li>
            <li>Crack 4 eggs into a bowl and season with ¼ teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon white pepper, ½ teaspoon sesame oil, and 1 teaspoon Shaoxing wine. Beat eggs for a minute.</li>
            <li>Preheat the wok over medium heat until it just starts to smoke. Then add 2 tablespoons of oil and immediately add the eggs. Scramble the eggs and remove from the wok immediately. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Add 1 more tablespoon oil to the wok, turn up the heat to high, and add the tomatoes and scallions. Stir-fry for 1 minute, and then add 2 teaspoons sugar, ½ teaspoon salt, and ¼ cup water (if your stove gets very hot and liquid tends to cook off very quickly in your wok, add a little more water). Add the cooked eggs.</li>
            <li>Mix everything together, cover the wok, and cook for 1-2 minutes, until the tomatoes are completely softened.</li>
            <li>Uncover, and continue to stir-fry over high heat until the sauce thickens to your liking. Serve!</li>
        </ol>
